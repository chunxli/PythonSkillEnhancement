# InsightCapture Roadmap

Windows Desktop Application with Azure Open AI

## Basic Stage: Setup and Simple Screenshot Functionality

### Objective
Establish the foundation of your application with the capability to capture and save screenshots.

### Tasks
- [ ] **Environment Setup**: Set up your Python development environment with Python, pip, and virtualenv.
- [ ] **GUI Library Decision**: Research and decide on the GUI library for the desktop application (e.g., Tkinter).
- [ ] **Implement Screenshot Functionality**: Use `pyautogui` to capture the entire screen and save screenshots to a predefined location.
- [ ] **Basic UI Creation**: Create a basic user interface to trigger screenshot actions and display the saved images.

## Intermediate Stage: Integrate Azure Services and Expand Functionality

### Objective
Integrate Azure Cognitive Services for image and text analysis, and start processing screenshots with added complexity.

### Tasks
- [ ] **Azure Setup**: Sign up for Azure and configure Azure Cognitive Services (Computer Vision API and OCR).
- [ ] **Text Extraction Implementation**: Use Azure OCR for screenshots containing text to extract information.
- [ ] **Image Analysis Integration**: Use Azure's Computer Vision API for non-text screenshots to analyze content.
- [ ] **Data Handling Logic**: Develop logic to handle and preprocess screenshot data before sending it to Azure services.
- [ ] **UI Enhancement**: Enhance the UI to display analysis results and allow users to input questions about the screenshot content.

## Advanced Stage: Azure Open AI Integration and Polishing

### Objective
Fully integrate Azure Open AI for querying and refine the user interface for an optimal user experience.

### Tasks
- [ ] **Integrate Azure Open AI Service**: Send preprocessed data (text or image descriptions) to Azure Open AI and receive insights.
- [ ] **Advanced Screenshot Functionality**: Implement functionality for users to select specific areas of the screen for capture and analysis.
- [ ] **UI/UX Enhancement**: Improve the UI/UX with intuitive design elements, including query history, favorite responses, and interactive querying features.
- [ ] **User Feedback Mechanism**: Incorporate mechanisms for user feedback to refine AI model accuracy over time.
- [ ] **Testing and Optimization**: Conduct thorough testing to identify bugs, and optimize performance for better user experience.
- [ ] **Documentation and Deployment**: Prepare comprehensive user documentation and deploy the application for easy installation.

## Project Management Tips
- [ ] **Use Version Control**: Utilize Git from the start to manage your application's development versions.
- [ ] **Iterative Development**: Build and improve the application in phases, ensuring each feature is robust before advancing.
- [ ] **Gather User Feedback**: Obtain early feedback from potential users to inform development priorities and adjustments.
